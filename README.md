Form Validation using JavaScript
A simple form validation project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates how to validate user inputs on the client side, ensuring that form data is accurate and complete before submission.

Features
Client-side form validation using vanilla JavaScript.
Validates required fields, email format, and password complexity.
Displays error messages for invalid inputs in real time.
Prevents form submission until all inputs are valid.
User-friendly and responsive design.
Technologies Used
HTML5 for the form structure.
CSS3 for styling the form and error messages.
JavaScript (ES6) for validating user input.

Form Validation Rules
The project includes validation for:

Required fields: Ensures that no required fields are left empty.
Email validation: Ensures the email is in the correct format (e.g., example@example.com).
